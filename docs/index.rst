The RAD Flow
=============

Introduction
------------

The RAD flow is an open source academic architecture exploration and evaluation flow for novel beyond-FPGA 
reconfigurable acceleration devices (RADs). These devices incorporate conventional FPGA fabrics, several coarse-grained 
domain-specialized accelerator blocks, and high-performance packet-switched networks-on-chip (NoCs) for system-level 
communication. The flow consists of the following tools:

- **RAD-Sim:** A SystemC simulator for rapid design space exploration and architecture-application co-design

- **RAD-Gen:** A push button tool for silicon area/timing/power implementation results of hard (ASIC) RAD components, FPGA fabric circuitry, and different 3D considerations (Under development)
